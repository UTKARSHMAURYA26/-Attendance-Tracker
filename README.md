## Features

- Load student data from an Excel file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for working with Excel files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required library using pip: pip install openpyxl
4. Create an Excel file named "student_data.xlsx" with student names and their initial attendance status (True for present, False for absent) in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. Run the script: the script name can be anything you choose. You should specify the actual name of your Python script that contains the attendance tracking code.

2. The script will load the student data, check attendance based on a threshold, and update the attendance data back to the Excel file.
